# Configuring [Steam](https://steampowered.com)
First, log in to Steam.

Open Steam (It's pre-installed when you enable Features, if you didn't do it open konsole and run: ```sudo pacman -S steam``` or run: ```sudo nogeeselinux-features enable```)

When the Steam log in window pops up, log in.

Go to Steam > Settings > Compatibility and enable Steam Play.

Restart Steam like the pop-up says, and now you're ready to game.
