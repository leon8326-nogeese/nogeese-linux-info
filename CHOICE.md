# Nogeese Supports Choice
GNU/Linux is "free as in freedom".

I wanted to have this make sense and make sure a lot of things Nogeese provides are to users choice.

You don't need Nogeese Features to run Nogeese Linux, you can choose KDE or GNOME, maybe even no desktop at all, and it all depends on your choice.

Like everything in Linux.

(Well, not [systemd](https://systemd.io). :\)
