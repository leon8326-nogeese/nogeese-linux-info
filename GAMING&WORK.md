# Gaming & Work on Nogeese Linux Workstation
You should know that when i say pre-installed on Nogeese linux i mean it's a part of features-core/work-and-games (optional package).
## Gaming Info
All Windows compatible Games should work, except some.

A good thing to know is when you set up Nogeese Linux, is that it comes with [Steam](https://steampowered.com) pre-installed.

When you set up Steam follow this tutorial to configure it properly: [Steam on Nogeese Linux](https://github.com/leon8326-nogeese/nogeese-linux-info/blob/main/STEAM.md).

After that you can play (almost) any Steam game made for Windows or Linux.

What about games not on Steam?

Well, here comes [Lutris](https://lutris.net)

It's pre-installed on Nogeese Linux too.

You can foind a tutorial on it here too: [Lutris on Nogeese Linux](https://github.com/leon8326-nogeese/nogeese-linux-info/blob/main/LUTRIS.md)

But why not all Windows Games work?

Well mostly because of KERNEL-LEVEL ANTICHEAT.

Everybody hates Kernel-Level Anticheat, but what is it?

Well, in Windows if you install it, it will grant it access to EVERYTHING.

Hardware, Software, you get it?

Now when linux when we run these programs, they get confused.

And don't let you play the because it thinks your cheating.

So, [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com), [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com), they all won't work.

Hopefully Kernel-Level Anticheat won't exist anymore in the future.
